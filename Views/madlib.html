<h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
    <p>One day, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 were walking through the woods,
    when suddenly a giant @Model.Animal - @Model.Animal2 appeared. "@Model.Exclamation!"
    @Model.Person1 cried. The two of them @Model.Verb as quickly as possible,
    and when they were safe, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 gave each other a
    giant @Model.Noun. But they were @Model.Verb2 by @Model.Animal - @Model.Animal2. @Model.Exclamation!</p>
